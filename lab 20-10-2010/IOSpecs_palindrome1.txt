IO Specifications:
******************
 - Input: receives a lower case word.
 - Output: prints if the word is a palindrome or not.

Algorithm:
**********
 - the program reads the lower case word (s1).
 - uses another string, s2, and, in the while loop, it constructs the
reverse of string 1 (s1).
 - it compares the 2 strings; if they are the same, prints that 
string 1 (s1) is a palindrome, if they are not the same, prints
that s1 is not a palindrome.

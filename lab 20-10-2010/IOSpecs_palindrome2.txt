IO Specifications:
******************
 - Input: receives a lower case word.
 - Output: prints if the word is a palindrome or not.

Algorithm:
**********
 - the program reads the lower case word (s1).
 - uses another string, s2, to create the reverse of the string s1,
using the recursive function reverse(s); this function returns the 
reverse of string s.
 - if the two strings (s1 and s2) are the same, then the program
prints that s1 is a palindrome; else, it prints that s1 is not a 
palindrome.

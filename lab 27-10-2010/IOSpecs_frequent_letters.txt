IO Specifications:
******************
 - Input: receives a list of words from a file named 'crosswords.txt' that is in the same folder 
	  as the script is.
 - Output: prints the frequency of the each alphabet letter in a word from the input file.

Algorithm:
**********
 - the program gets each word from the input file.
 - going through all the words in the input file, the scripts counts the number of words.
 - using a function (has_ch), the program searches each word from the input file for each letter
   of the alphabet. If it finds it, it increments the corresponding element from a list of 
   frequencies, using the ASCII code of the respective character (like ord('a') - 97 = 0, therefore,
   incrementing the element 0, which is the first element, of the list of frequencies).
 - it goes through all the elements of the list of frequencies and finds the maximum frequency along
   with its most frequent character
 - prints the number of words from the input file; prints the frequencies of all the letters of the 
   alphabet that are found in the words from them input files; prints the most frequent letter.

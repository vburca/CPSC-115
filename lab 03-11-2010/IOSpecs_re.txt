IO Specifications:
******************
 - Input: receives a list of words from a file named 'crosswords.txt' that is in the same folder 
	  as the script is.
 - Output: prints the words that have 're' as a preffix.

Algorithm:
**********
 - the program gets each word from the input file.
 - going through all the words in the input file, the scripts counts the number of words.
 - by checking if each word has 're' as a preffix, it verifies whether or not it is the shortest/longest
word with 're' as a preffix and makes the corresponding changes.
 - prints the total number of words in the list, the number of words that start with 're' and the words that
start with 're'.

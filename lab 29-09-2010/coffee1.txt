I/O Specifications & Algorithm:
*******************************

Input variables: price - gets the price for one pound as a value.
		 pounds - gets the number of pounds as a value.

Output variables: total_cost - after the total cost is computed in this variable, it is printed.

Algorithm: - the program reads the price for one pound and the number of pounds
 	   - after that, it computes the total cost of the order (including the delivery tax and the overhead charge
	   - it prints the variable total_cost, which is the total cost of the order
